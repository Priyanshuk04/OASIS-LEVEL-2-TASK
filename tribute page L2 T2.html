        <h2>Why I Admire Ronaldo</h2>
        <p>
            Cristiano Ronaldo is not just a footballer — he is a symbol of hard work, discipline, and determination.
            From humble beginnings in Madeira, Portugal, to becoming one of the greatest players in football history,
            his journey is nothing short of inspiring.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I admire most about Ronaldo is his relentless drive to improve himself. Even at the peak of his career,
            he trains harder than anyone, always pushing limits. His mindset, focus, and dedication to his craft
            motivate millions of fans around the world, including me.
        </p>

        <h2>Achievements</h2>
        <p>
            Ronaldo has won multiple Ballon d'Or awards, UEFA Champions League titles, and national trophies with clubs
            like Manchester United, Real Madrid, and Juventus. He's also the all-time leading goal scorer in the UEFA
            Champions League.
        </p>
        <p>
            Beyond football, Ronaldo is a philanthropist and role model. He donates to children's hospitals, supports
            disaster relief, and inspires youth worldwide to follow their dreams with passion and persistence.
